# Lets play a game
We have been learning about classes recently, so lets start building something slightly more complex than we have completed so far.

What I want us to create is a simple tic tac toe game. This first assignment will be creating the classes that we will use for the game.

To create the game, we will create a `board` class to represent the tic tac toe board,

and we will create a `square` class to represent each of the 9 squares on the board.

The square class should have a `value` attribute that is initialized to an empty string ''.

The `value` attribute should have getters and setters defined for it.

*Remember, you can use attribute properties to define these easily*

The board class should initialize 9 squares when it is created.

The board class should have a `show` method that will display the board, with the value in each square.

When the `show` method is called, the output should be similar to below.

```
  |  | 
--------
  |  | 
--------
  |  | 
```

In future homework we will implement the logic to play the game.
