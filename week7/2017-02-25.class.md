# Review: Return

Say we have this code

```ruby
def main
  die_1 = roll_die_1
  die_2 = roll_die_2
  sum = die_1 + die_2
end

def roll_dice_1
  print 'Dice 1: '
  puts rand(1..6)
end

def roll_dice_2
  print 'Dice 2: '
  puts rand(1..6)
end

main
```

Copy it. Run it. What happens? How can we fix this?

# Creating Classes

You can write whatever methods you want for your new data object.

```ruby
class Album
  def price
    23
  end
end
```

The price method can only be called on an instance of the Album class.

Try this

```ruby
class Album
  def price
    23
  end
end

def price
  54
end

album = Album.new

puts "album.price: #{album.price}"
puts "price: #{price}"
```

Notice that you cannot call `Album.price`. It will throw an error.

#  Programming Tips

When you are new to programming, it can be frustrating.
* Don't know where to start
* Feel lost
* Get stuck and don't know how to proceed
* Too much to learn and remember
* See a solution in your head, but can't translate it to code

To work through these challenges:
* Practice, practice, practice
* Break problems down and solve the smallest part first
* Research and review what you already know
* Experiment and test, it will help you see things differently
* Take a break after looking at a problem for a while

Being a programmer is like

# Attribute properties
Writing getters and setters for properties requires a lot of repetative, simple code.

```ruby
class Person
  def name=(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end

  def name
    @name
  end

  def age=(new_age)
    @age = new_age
  end

  def age
    @age
  end
end
```

Ruby provides *attribute* properties to make it simpler to declare instance variables with getters and setters

```ruby
class Person
  attr_reader :mother    # Creates an instance variable @mother with a getter method
  attr_writer :age       # Creates an instance variable @age with a setter method
  attr_accessor :name    # Creates an instance variable @name with getter and setter methods
end
```

You can even create multiple attribute properties on the same line

```ruby
class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :age
  attr_reader :mother, :father
end
```

Nice, but where are the `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`, and `attr_accessor` methods defined?

They are *class methods* of `Object`


## Challenge

Write an `Album` class so that it can hold information about it's name, release year, and number of songs on the disc(s).

Allow the album to be initialized with any of that information.

Create attribute properties to be able to read and modify those values

### Album.new is just another object

Just like with other objects (like strings, numbers, booleans), you can place them inside logic or collections like arrays or hashes.

```ruby
# album_program.rb
album1 = Album.new "Thriller"
album2 = Album.new "Bad"
album3 = Album.new "To Pimp A Butterfly"

[album1, album2, album3].each do |album|
  p album.get_name
end
```

```bash
# output
Thriller
Bad
To Pimp A Butterfly
```
