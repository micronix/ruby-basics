# Review: Return

Say we have this code

```ruby
def main
  die_1 = roll_die_1
  die_2 = roll_die_2
  sum = die_1 + die_2
end

def roll_dice_1
  print 'Dice 1: '
  puts rand(1..6)
end

def roll_dice_2
  print 'Dice 2: '
  puts rand(1..6)
end

main
```

Copy it. Run it. What happens? How can we fix this?

##  Thoughts & feelings

If you are new to programmer, it can feel frustrating and you feel lost.

- Don't even know where to start
- Trying to put in code what you see in your head
- Working with a lot of data

Things you can do

- practice
- solve smallest possible problem first
- research
- experiment

Being a programmer is like

# New Material

## Writing your own classes

You can make your own classes. You don't have to rely on pre-existing ones.

```ruby
class Album
end
```

## New class with new methods

You can write whatever methods you want for your new data object.

```ruby
class Album
  def price
    23
  end
end
```

The price method can only be called on an instance of the Album class.

Try this

```ruby
class Album
  def price
    23
  end
end

def price
  54
end

album = Album.new

puts "album.price: #{album.price}"
puts "price: #{price}"
```

Notice that you cannot call `Album.price`. It will throw an error.

## New objects with some data

`Album.new` is nice, but what if I want to give it a name? When I run this code: `Album.new("Thriller")` I expect the new object to take that information and keep it for later.

If you run that code now, it will blow up. We get an `ArgumentError`. We've seen those before. We just have to edit the method to take the number of arguments that we want it to.

Sadly, you can't just say `def new(name)` and expect to overwrite it like that. `new` is a special method that comes with all of ruby. In order to override it, use `initialize` instead.

### Overwriting the `new` method

```ruby
class Album
  def initialize
  end
end
```

In order to get `Album.new("thriller")` to run, we need something like this

```ruby
class Album
  def initialize(name)
    puts "I have been created with the name #{name}"
  end
end
```

Ok but what if I want to get the name later??

```ruby
class Album
  def initialize(name)
    puts "I have been created with the name #{name}"
  end

  def get_name

  end
end
```

How do we make the `get_name` method access the name??

### Instance variables

We've talked before about methods and variables.

```ruby
outside_variable = 1
def method(inside_variable = 2)
end
```

Here, `outside_variable` is not available inside the `method` method unless we pass it as an argument/parameter.

Also, `inside_variable` is not available outside the `method` method. Ever.

Well, there is another type of variable. As you can guess from the title up there, it's called an instance variable. It's just like a regular variable, exceept it's available everywhere. It begins with an `@` symbol.

```ruby
outside_variable = 1
@instance_variable = 3
def method(inside_variable = 2)
  puts @instance_variable
end
```

Now when we run `method` we will see 3 printed out.

We can also say

```ruby
def method(inside_variable = 2)
  @instance_variable = 3
end

method

puts @instance_variable
```

This code will also print the number 3. The difference here is that the variable was set inside the method. The time before, the variable was set outside the method.

### Back to Albums

That's cool. Use that information to make any instance method access instance variables.

```ruby
class Album
  def initialize(name)
    @contant_name = name
    puts "I have been created with the name #{name}"
  end

  def get_name
    @contant_name
  end
```

## Challenge

Write the `Album` class so that it can hold information about it's name, release year, and number of songs on the disc(s).

### Updating album information

What if we want to change an album's information after it has already been initialized?

Just write a method that overwrites the instance variable.

```ruby
class Album
  def initialize(name)
    @constant_name = name
    puts "I have been created with the name #{name}"
  end

  def get_name
    @constant_name
  end

  def change_name(name)
    @constant_name = name
  end
end
```

Now you can say something like

```ruby
album = Album.new("Thriller")
album.get_name # should return "Thriller"
album.change_name("Bad")
album.get_name # should return "Bad"
```

### Album.new is just another object

Just like with other objects (like strings, numbers, booleans), you can place them inside logic or collections like arrays or hashes.

```ruby
# album_program.rb
album1 = Album.new "Thriller"
album2 = Album.new "Bad"
album3 = Album.new "To Pimp A Butterfly"

[album1, album2, album3].each do |album|
  p album.get_name
end
```

```bash
# output
I have been created with the name Thriller
I have been created with the name Bad
I have been created with the name To Pimp A Butterfly
Thriller
Bad
To Pimp A Butterfly
```
