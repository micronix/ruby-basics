## Review

### Hashes
A hash is an object that uses *keys* mapped to *values* to store other objects.

A hash is written as `hash = {}` or `hash = Hash.new`

Objects are stored and read from a hash using array like syntax

```ruby
hash = {}
hash[42] = 'The answer'   # Stores 'The answer' in the hash with a key of 42
puts hash[42]             # Writes out the value, 'The answer', stored at key 42 in the hash

```

### Files

To begin working with a file
```ruby
file = open("file.txt")
```
Maybe save it to a variable
```ruby
file = open("file.txt")
```
You can then get the content of that file
```ruby
file.read
```
Save it to a variable if you'll use it later
```ruby
text = file.read
```
You can also write to files *(more info [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7911669/create-file-in-ruby))*
```ruby
file = open('file.txt', 'w')
file.puts "This is more text"
```
Don't forget to close the file
```ruby
file.close
```
You can load a YAML file and turn it into a hash like
```ruby
require 'yaml'
hash = YAML.load(File.read('data.yml'))
```
You also can turn a hash into YAML
```ruby
hash.to_yaml
```

## Challenge
Write a program that takes input like name and age.

```bash
Name: Bob
Age: 14
Name: Josh
Age: 25
Name:
```
The program should save info into a file. Call it `ages.yml`

Next time the program runs, it should load the info, and keep adding, and save all of that to the file.

## Method parameter default values

You can set default values for the parameters which will be used if a method is called without passing required parameters:
```ruby
def my_method(name = "", age = 0)
  # code
end
```

Whenever you call the simple method, you write only the method name as follows:
```ruby
my_method
```
However, when you call a method with parameters, you write the method name along with the parameters, such as:
```ruby
my_method "Bob", 30
```
## Keyword arguments

Besides your regular way of writing parameters
```ruby
def my_method(name, age)
```
You can also use symbols for parameters
```ruby
def my_method(name:, age:)
  # name and age variables are now available
end
```
You can also set default values like this
```ruby
def my_method(name: '', age: 0)
```
Now you can call the method like
```ruby
my_method(name: 'Bob', age: 30)
```

## Splat operator for variable number of parameters
If you don't know how many parameters your method will receive you can use the splat operator like so
```ruby
def method(*things)
  p things
  p things.class
end

method(1,2,3)

#=> [1, 2, 3]
#=> Array
```

## Mixing and matching the various types of arguments

```ruby
def some_method(a, b=5, *p) # correct
def some_method(a, *p, b=5) # incorrect!!!
```

## Object review
Everything in Ruby is an object

Objects have methods and properties/attributes

If you think of objects like language, you could say
* Objects are nouns
* Methods are verbs
* Properties/attributes are adjectives

# Classes
Objects are modelled with a *class*

There is no perfect real world analogy to a class, but they are similar to:
* blueprints
* factories
* cookie cutter
* molds *for making things, not the fungus*

Every object in Ruby has a class

An object is an *instance* of a class

## Creating Classes

A class is created using the `class` Keyword

```ruby
class Thing
end
```

## Creating objects from a class

You create an object by calling the `new` method on the class for that object


Calling new on a class does some background work and then calls the `initialize` method on the class

```ruby
class Thing
  def initialize
    puts "Creating a thing"
  end
end

thing1 = Thing.new
```

## Instance methods
An instance method is a method that can be called on an object of that class types

Instance methods are defined inside the `class` and are shared between every object of that class types

In the code above, `initialize` is an instance method

## Instance variables
Instance variables represent the state of the object

Instance variables are unique to each instance of an object

Instance variables are declared with an `@` symbols

```ruby
class Thing
  def initialize(question: "how many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?", answer: "None, it's a hardware problem.")
    @question = question
    @answer = answer
    puts "Creating a thing"
  end

  def joke
    puts @question
    puts @answer
  end
end

thing2 = Thing.new
thing2.joke
```
