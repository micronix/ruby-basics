# Review

## Method parameters
Default values

Symbol parameters

Splat parameters

## Classes
Creating a class

Initializing the properties of a class

Creating an instance method

Creating an instance variable

# More on Objects

## Getters and Setters
We know how to create instance variables, using the @ symbol, but how can you read or change those values outside instance methods?

```ruby
class Joke
  def initialize(question: "how many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?", answer: "None, it's a hardware problem.")
    @question = question
    @answer = answer
  end

  def tell_joke
    puts @question
    puts @answer
  end
end

programmer_joke = Joke.new
programmer_joke.tell_joke
programmer_joke.question #=> NoMethodError
programmer_joke.@question #=> SyntaxError
```

You use getters and setters. These are methods that *get* an instance variable and return it and *set* and instance variable.

```ruby
class Joke
  def initialize(question: "how many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?", answer: "None, it's a hardware problem.")
    @question = question
    @answer = answer
  end

  def question(question)
    @question = question
  end

  def question
    @question
  end

  def answer(answer)
    @answer = answer
  end

  def answer
    @answer
  end

  def tell_joke
    puts @question
    puts @answer
  end
end

joke = Joke.new
joke.tell_joke
puts joke.question
puts joke.answer

joke.question = "When does a joke become a dad joke?"
joke.answer = "When it becomes apparent."
joke.tell_joke
```

## Adding to already existing classes aka "Monkey patching"

You can add methods to existing classes by doing something like this

```ruby
class Joke
  def groan
    puts "Groan! What a bad joke."
  end
end
```
When you add an instance method to a class, it is available on all objects that were created from that class

You can even do this for classes that you didn't define yourself.

```ruby
class String
  def my_monkey_patch
    "I have hacked into the String class!"
  end
end
```

You can also overwrite existing class instance methods like this

```ruby
class String
  def length
    "I have hacked a pre-existing method in the String class!"
  end
end
```

## `self`

What if we want to do something with the instance?
Such as repeating a joke in a different joke method; or take a string, reverse its order and make it all uppercase?

Solution:

```ruby
class Joke
  def groan
    puts "What a bad joke, never tell it again!"
    self.tell_joke
    puts "Why! Why did you do that."
  end
end
```

```ruby
class String
  def my_monkey_patch
    self.reverse.upcase
  end
end
```

## Inheritance
As you write more classes and create more objects, you will begin to see that there are many methods and properties that are common between objects.

Lets take our joke example. What are some different types of jokes?

What do they have in common?

What is different between them?

Now, let's look at a more canonical example of a vehicles.

What are some characteristics of a car?

What are some characteristics of a truck?




## Inheritance and Instances

Everything has a class

```bash
irb(main):026:0> 4.class
=> Fixnum
irb(main):026:0> 4.class.superclass
=> Integer
irb(main):026:0> 4.class.superclass.superclass
=> Numeric
irb(main):026:0> 4.class.superclass.superclass.superclass
=> Object
irb(main):026:0> 4.class.superclass.superclass.superclass.superclass
=> BasicObject
```

Here is a little chart of inheritance.

```ruby
BasicObject
  Object
    Numeric
      Float
      Integer
        Fixnum
    String
    Array
    TrueClass
    FalseClass
    NilClass
    Hash
    Symbol
    Regexp
    Range
```

## Inherited instance methods
**Each class defines their own instance methods**

Try running these commands in `irb`

```bash
3.methods
Integer.instance_methods
Fixnum.instance_methods
```

You should see that `3.methods` has more methods than `Integer.instance_methods`. 
You should also see that `3.methods` have the same exact methods as `Fixnum.instance_methods`

Now run these commands in `irb`

```bash
3.methods - Object.instance_methods
3.methods - Numeric.instace_methods
3.methods - Integer.instance_methods
3.methods - Fixnum.instance_methods
```

You should see that each successive line returns a smaller array. 

That's because when you run run `3.methods - Object.instance_methods` you are really saying "Give me all the methods except Object instance methods".

When you execute `3.methods - Numeric.instance_methods` you are really saying "Give me all of `3`'s methods except Numeric methods".

When you say `3.methods - Integer.instance_methods` you are really saying "Give me all methods minus Integer methods".

`Object`, `Numeric`, `Integer`, and `Fixnum` all have their own set of methods.

When you say `Fixnum.instance methods` you are really getting Fixnum methods, Integer methods, Numeric methods, and Object methods.

## Writing you own class methods




- Math is messages being passed to objects as well!!!
  - `2 + 2.3`
  - Overriding arithmetic operations (e.g. `def +(other) ... end`)

## Challenge

Write the `sum` method for arrays so that

```ruby
[1,2,3].sum # should return 6
```

## Require

```ruby
require "./array.rb"
```
