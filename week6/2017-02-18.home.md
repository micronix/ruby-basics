# Homework

These exercises reinforce concepts like file loading, menus, and recursion.

## Morse Code

Design a program that asks the user for input and encrypts the string into morse code.

The program should load a YAML file with all the characters and their morse code equivalents into the program.

That data should be used to convert a string into morse code and print it out.

Here is a morse code table

|character|code|   |character|code|
|:-------:|:--:|---|:-------:|:--:|
|space| *space*|   |  G  |  --.   |
|comma| --..-- |   |  H  |  ....  |
|period|.-.-.- |   |  I  |  ..    |
|  ?  | ..--.. |   |  J  |  .---  |
|  0  |  ----- |   |  K  |  -.-   |
|  1  |  .---- |   |  L  |  .-..  |
|  2  |  ..--- |   |  M  |  --    |
|  3  |  ...-- |   |  N  |  -.    |
|  4  |  ....- |   |  O  |  ---   |
|  5  |  ..... |   |  P  |  .---. |
|  6  |  -.... |   |  Q  |  --.-  |
|  7  |  --... |   |  R  |  .-.   |
|  8  |  ---.. |   |  S  |  ...   |
|  9  |  ----. |   |  T  |  -     |
|  A  |  .-    |   |  U  |  ..-   |
|  B  |  -...  |   |  V  |  ...-  |
|  C  |  -.-.  |   |  W  |  .--   |
|  D  |  -..   |   |  X  |  -..-  |
|  E  |  .     |   |  Y  |  -.--  |
|  F  |  ..-.  |   |  Z  |  --..  |

Sample output

```bash
Morse Code Converter
Type something
> sup # user types sup
... # morse code for S
..- # morse code for U
.---. # morse code for P
> # user types nothing. program closes
```

## Unit conversion program

We need a program that converts the following measurements form English units to metric units.
- Convert inches to centimeters.
- Convert feet to meters.
- Convert miles to kilometers.

Here are the formulas for making these conversions:
- *centimeters* = *inches* x 2.54
- *meters* = *feet* x 0.3048
- *kilometers* = *miles* x 1.60934

The program should display a menu, like the one below, that allow the user to select the conversion that he or she wants to perform.

```bash
1. Convert inches to centimeters.
2. Convert feet to meters.
3. Convert miles to kilometers.

Enter you selection.
```

Possible output is

<pre>
1. Convert inches to centimeters.
2. Convert feet to meters.
3. Convert miles to kilometers.

Enter you selection.
<b>1 [Enter]</b>
Enter the number of inches.
<b>10 [Enter]</b>
That is equal to 25.4 centimeters.

1. Convert inches to centimeters.
2. Convert feet to meters.
3. Convert miles to kilometers.

Enter you selection.
<b>2 [Enter]</b>
Enter the number of feet.
<b>10 [Enter]</b>
That is equal to 3.048 meters.

1. Convert inches to centimeters.
2. Convert feet to meters.
3. Convert miles to kilometers.

Enter you selection.
<b>3 [Enter]</b>
Enter the number of miles.
<b>10 [Enter]</b>
That is equal to 16.09 kilometers.

1. Convert inches to centimeters.
2. Convert feet to meters.
3. Convert miles to kilometers.

Enter you selection.
<b>4 [Enter]</b>
That is an invalid selection. Enter 1, 2, or 3.
</pre>

You will have to use loops and methods to keep this code readable and easy to understand.

## Rocket launch countdown

Write a program that counts down a rocket launch!

### Normal mode

Write a program that gets an integer from the user and begins a rocket launch countdown
Try to replicate one of these:

[[VIDEO](https://youtu.be/OnoNITE-CLc?t=1m)]

[[ANOTHER ONE](https://youtu.be/wCy401hkXuk)]

[[FAVORITE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V9TCD0TTtk)]

The output should look something like this

```bash
Seconds before countdown: 24 # user types 24
20
15
12
11
10
9
iGNITION SEQUENCE START
6
5
4
3
2
1
ALL ENGINES RUNNING
LIFTOFF
```

As you can see. We count down by 5's until we get to 12. Then we start counting by 1's. 
The program than says "ignition sequence start", which takes about 3 seconds, and we continue counting down. 
In normal mode, don't worry about the messages actually appearing on the screen 1 or 5 seconds apart. 
It's ok if it all prints out at the same time.

## Hard mode

Now you can worry about the messages being 1 or 5 seconds apart. 
Find a way to get the countdown to actually count down in seconds rather than printing everything all at once.

## Nighmare mode

Now rewrite your code so that it is recursive. Remember, a recursive method is a method that calls itself.

For example:

```ruby
def method
  puts "hello world"
  method
end

method
```

When you execute the file, we get

```bash
hello world
hello world
hello world
hello world
hello world
hello world
# continues forever until we get "SystemStackError: stack level too deep"
```
