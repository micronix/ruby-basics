# Array Practice

## Indexing arrays

What do the following expressions evaluate to?

```ruby
a = ['A', 'wise', 'old', 'owl', 'lived', 'in', 'an', oak',
     'The', 'more', 'he', 'heard', 'the', 'less', 'he', 'spoke']
```

- a[1 + 2]
- a[3].length
- a[3].length < a[6].length
- a[7].length / 2
- a[2] + 'dlo'
- a.length + a[1].length

## Counting words

Strings have a method that can be used to create an array from a string. The method is called *split* and you can read more about it in the [documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html#method-i-split). For example the following *"who is there".split(' ')* evaluates to *['who', 'is', 'there'].

Write a program that asks the user to type something and count the number of words they typed.

_Hint: use the split method then use the length method in an array to know how many items the array has_

## Averages

Write a program that asks the user for 5 numbers and then calculates the average of the 5 numbers.

_Hint: Use ranges like in class and use the sum method in arrays_
