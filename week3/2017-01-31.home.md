# Homework

Do as many as you can.

If you're a savage, do them all.

## Work hours

Write a program that

* gets number of hours worked for 5 days
* gets hourly rate (10 for $10/hr)
* outputs the total money earned
```
# total is 40
# rate is 10
$400.00
```
## Pythagorean theorem

Write a program that
* takes two inputs, the two legs to a right triangle
* outputs the length of the hypotenuse

## Stars

Write a program that gets an integer from the user, then prints this pattern:

    # User enters 4

    *
    **
    ***
    ****

    # User enters 6

    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ******

## Healthy Eating

In class we ate a lot of fruit as we learned methods.

Building on that, fill in the missing code in the following program

```ruby
bag_of_fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'apple', 'mango', 'strawberry']
bag_of_veggies = ['celery', 'onion', 'carrot', 'corn', 'lettuce']

def eat_a_bag_of_food(bag_of_food)
    # call the eat_a_piece_of_food method for each item in the bag_of_food
end

def eat_a_piece_of_food(food)
    puts "Eating a #{food}"
end

eat_a_bag_of_food(bag_of_fruits)
eat_a_bag_of_food(bag_of_veggies)
```

## Print all the longest words
In class we worked the following problem
```ruby
list = ['bananas', 'potatoes', 'mangos', 'raspberry', 'persimmon', 'kiwi']
longest = ''
list.each do |word|
  if longest.length < word.length
    longest = word
  end
end
puts longest
```

Now, starting with that program modify it so that it will print out each word that is the longest word.

In this case it should print out both 'raspberry' and 'persimmon'.

_hint_ Store the longest words in an array, but make sure the array is cleared when a new longest word is found

## User Input Statistics

### Normal mode

Create a program that that takes the user's input 5 times.

The user's input should be numbers only.

After 5 inputs from the user, the program should output

* The lowest number entered
* The highest number entered
* The mean
* The median
* The range

If a number is not entered, ask again.

### Hard mode

Extend your program so that it can accept strings as well.

If the user inputs

* horse
* bear
* cat
* mouse
* dog

The output should be the array sorted in alphabetical order

The program should ask what input to expect. If user picks numbers, it runs like normal mode. If user picks strings, it runs like hard mode. Mixing of number values and strings is unacceptable and will cause the program to shut down.

### Nightmare mode

When the user is inputting numbers, add the following statistics to the output:

* Standard deviation

When the user is inputting strings, add the following statistics to the output:

* average string length
* number of times letter `e` was entered
