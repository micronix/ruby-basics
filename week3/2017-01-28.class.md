# Arrays
An array is a object that contains a list of items (objects) in order
Arrays are:
* dynamically sized
* zero-index
* can be mixed type

## Creating Arrays

```ruby
a = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
empty_array = []
food = ["pizza", "ice cream", "hamburger"]
mixed_types = ["hello", true, 3.1415, 7]
```
How can we access individual items in an array?

Arrays have an index for each position in the array, and the index starts at 0.

![array indexes](http://104.131.54.109/images/b/bf/Indexing.png)

To access an array item, put the name of the array followed by square bracked containing the index

```ruby
a = [6,5,4]
a[0]    # => 6
a[1]    # => 5
a[2]    # => 4
```

## Exercise
Evaluate the following expressions assuming that the following array is set

```ruby
a = [1, 7, 11, 19]

a[1]
a[1+1]
a[-1]
a[18]
a["0".to_i]
```

Create the following arrays in irb

- Array with 3 integers
- Array with with the strings "bob", "alice", "charlie"
- Array with two booleans and 1 integer

## Reading array elements

Given the following array, what is the index of the values given?

```ruby
array = [1, 8, 3, 4, nil, "old", 7.1, true, 4,  nil]
```

- "old"
- 8
- true
- 7.1
- 4
- nil

What is the length of the array?

## Expressions which includes arrays

The operation of indexing an array can be combined with other operations to create an expression. 

Assume that the following arrays have been defined for you and evaluate the following expressions

```ruby
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
b = ['elephant', 'cat', 'dog', 'tiger', 'camel']
c = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
d = [true, false, false, true]
```

- c[1]
- b[3]
- a[1 + 1]
- a[-1]
- a[5 / 2]
- b[a[1]]
- c[3] + a[1] < 2
- d[3] and d[0]
- c[10] or d[0]


## Modifying arrays

Remember that assignments store values in variables. 
We will now practice how we store things inside arrays. 
After the following assignments, what does the array a look like?

```ruby
a = [1, 'b', true]

a[0] = 5
a[2] = false
a[0 + 1] = 'c'
a[3] = 10
a[5] = 66
a[1] = nil
a[2] = 3 < 7 and 8 < 3

# Adding a new item to an array can be done multiple ways
a << 3
a.push "The end"
```

## Getting the length of an array
Arrays are objects like everything else we have seen in ruby

Objects have properties, and one property on an array object is its size

Properties can be read using the same dot syntax that we have used for calling methods on objects

```ruby
heroes = ["Wonder Woman", "Spiderman", "Doctor Strange"]
heroes.length   # => 3
heroes.size     # => 3
```

## Enumerating arrays

We will now combine looping through an array with if statements. 
This will enable us to check conditions on elements of an array. 
Predict what will happen in the following code.

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

a.each do |element|
  puts element
end
```

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

a.each do |element|
  # remember that % is modulo or remainder
  if element % 2 == 0
    puts element
  end
end
```

```ruby
a = ['dog', 'elephant', 'cat', 'penguin', 'rat', 'quail', 'bat']
a.each do |animal|
  if animal.length <= 3
    puts animal
  end
end
```

```ruby
a = [99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93]
a.each do |bottles|
  puts bottles + " bottles of beer on the wall..."
end
```

# Range type

What do the following programs output

```ruby
(1..5).each do |number|
  puts number
end
```

```ruby
a = []
(1..5).each do |number|
  a << number
end
puts a
```
