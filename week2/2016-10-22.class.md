# More expressions

[Class Video](http://youtu.be/vIG1rHwfvJo)

## Input/Output
Remember that the method to output characters to the screen is *puts*. The method to get input from the user is *gets*.

### Greeting program

Create a ruby program in a file called greeting.rb that gets information from the user, stores the information into variables and then output a witty message. For example:

```bash
What is your name? Bob
How old are you? 25
What is your favorite food? Popcorn

Hello Bob, Popcorn is really tasty. I'm sure it is popular with all 25 year olds.
```

## Boolean Comparison Expressions

Remember that a boolean expression evaluates to either True or False. What do the following boolean expressions evaluate to? Remember that you can check what they evaluate to by inputing them into irb

1. 5 < 10
2. 5 < 5
3. 10 - 1 > 3
4. 3 * 1 - 1 == 1 + 1
5. 5.0 / 2 == 5 / 2
6. "code".length - 1 > 2
7. "Bob" == "Alice"

## Boolean Logical Expressions

There are only a few possibilities with logical boolean operations. The best thing to do is memorize them. Test your knowledge with this

### and operator

1. true and true
2. true and false
3. false and true
4. false and false

### or operator
1. true or true
2. true or false
3. false or true
4. false or false

### not operator
1. not false
2. not true


## Combine it all together

define the following variables

age = 25
office = "American Underground"
pi = 3.14

Evaluate the following expressions

1. age > 10 and age < 20
2. age > 20 and age < 30
3. office.length > 20 or age < 12
4. pi * 2 < 7
5. not (office.length - 2 < 20)


## If statements

What will the following programs output:

```ruby
age = 17
if age > 18
  puts "you are not able to vote yet."
else
  puts "you are able to vote."
end
```

```ruby
name = "Bob Smith"
if name.length > 10
  puts "Your name is too long"
end
```

```ruby
if name == 'Bob'
  puts "Welcome Bob"
elsif name == 'Alice'
  puts 'Welcome Alice'
else
  name = 'You are not authorized'
end
```
