## Review

What is the output of the following programs:

```ruby
a = 1
b = "days"
puts (a + 3).to_s + " " + b
```

```ruby
b = 10
c = 11
puts (b + 1) <= (c - 1)
```

```ruby
number = gets.to_i
if number > 10
  puts "Big"
else
  puts "Small"
end
```

```ruby
print "What is your name? "
name = gets.chomp
print "Hello, " + name
if name == 'Bob'
  puts "What a nice name."
end
```

```ruby
number = gets.to_i
if number < 10
  number = number + 1
end
puts number
```

## Program to complete in class

```ruby
print "Enter your age: "
person1_age = gets.chomp
print "Enter the age of your friend: "
person2_age = gets.chomp

# print 'you are older than your friend' if you are older
# or print 'your friend is older than you' if they are older
```

## More details on logical expressions and nil
[Nothing](https://youtu.be/M5QGkOGZubQ)
Evaluate the following expressions, the new type that we have incorporated is the nil type. Assume the following varible assignments are made.

```ruby
password = "123"
age = 14
```

- nil.nil?
- !password.nil? and password == '12'
- age.nil? or 17
- nil and 10
- 77 and 18
- 77 or 18
- not 77
- not nil
- false and 33

What is nil?
It represents the absence of a value
It's and object of type Nil

## While loops

Until now, all of our code has moved sequentially through the program from top to bottom, like reading a book.
Now we will introduce the ability to run the same section of code multiple times

```ruby
password = "cookie"

print "Guess the password: "
guess = gets.chomp

while guess != password
  puts "Wrong! Here's a hint: my favorite kind is chocolate chip."
  print "Guess again: "
  guess = gets.chomp
end

puts "You guessed it!"
```

Lets write a number guessing program.
First have somebody put in a number.
