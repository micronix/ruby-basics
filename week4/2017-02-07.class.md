## Agenda
* Homework review
* Concepts
  * Abstraction
  * Algorithms
  * Composition
* Questions
* Ideas for programs to write, either alone or as a Class


## Abstraction
Hiding complexity by providing a simpler interface.

A common interface can be used to interact with systems that operate very differently internally.

Examples of abstraction:
* Steering wheel
* Video game controller
* Web browsers

## Algorithms
A process or set of rules to follow to solve a problem.

Examples of algorithms:
* Recipes
* Tying your shoes
* Driving to work/school
* Finding the longest string in an array
* Sorting an array of numbers

## Composition
Using simple pieces to create something complex.

Examples of composition:
* A symphony
* Legos
