# Methods Homework

## Referencing the Ruby documentation
It's useful to feel comfortable looking up information about Ruby that you don't already know.

We looked up the type of value returned for the `puts` method in class, and saw that it returned `nil`.

Using the Ruby documentation for array(https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/Array.html), find what type the `reverse` method returns.

What about the `reverse!` method? 

Can you figure out what is different between these two methods?


## Practice

Given that the following methods are defined, evaluate the expressions that follow:

```ruby
def add(a, b)
  return a + b
end

def mult(a, b)
  return a * b
end

def mult2(a)
  return a * 2
end
```

- add(6, 3)
- 1 + add(1, 1)
- mult(2+1, 3)
- mult(2, 4) + add(3, 2)
- mult(add(1,1), add(3,2))
- mult2(3)
- mult2(add(1,2))

## Writing Methods

### Sum & Product

Write a method that takes one parameter, an array and returns the sum of all the elements in the array. For example:

```ruby
sum([1,2,3]) # evaluates to 6
sum([3,3]) # evalutes to 6
```

Write a method takes one parameter, an array and returns the product of all the elements in the array. For example:

```ruby
prod([1,2,3]) # evaluates to 6
prod([3,3]) # evaluates to 9
```

### First and Last

Write a method that takes one string and returns an array with the first and last words. For example:

```ruby
first_and_last("hello there") # evaluates to ["hello", "there"]
first_and_last("The fox jumped over the fence") # evaluates to ["The", "fence"]
```

_Hint_: You can use the string `split` method.


### String joining

Write a method that takes two parameters, one array and one string and returns one string with the second string between each of the other strings. For example:

```ruby
join(["a", "b", "c"], ",") # evaluates to "a,b,c"
join(["hello", "there"], " ") # evaluates to "hello there"
join(["enter"], ",") # evaluates to "enter"
```

Notice that this method is the opposite of the `split` method for strings, So you should be able to do the following:

```ruby
join("hello there".split(" "), " ")
```

If you google how to do this, you will probably find that ruby already has a method on arrays called `join` that works as follows:

```ruby
["hello", "there"].join(" ")
```

*Don't use this method, that would be too easy, instead try to write what the method would do yourself.*

_Hint_: You will need an if statement to know if you are at the end of the array in order to know that you don't need to add the string in the middle.

# Practice with methods and arrays

This practice with methods are intended to give you practice with if statements and loops as well as methods.

Some of these methods are already part of a ruby array and you could implement some of these methods by simply calling the existing method. 

But that would not help you understand the concepts.

# Search an array

Write a method that searches an array for a given item and returns the position of the element in the array. For example:

```ruby
search([1,2,3], 2) # evaluates to 1 because 2 is at position 1
search(["cat", "bat", "rat"], "cat") # evaluates to 0
search([true, false, true, false, true], false) # evalutes to 1
search([], 3) # evaluates to nil
```
