# Methods Homework

## Practice

Given that the following methods are defined, evaluate the expressions that follow:

```ruby
def add(a, b)
  return a + b
end

def mult(a, b)
  return a * b
end

def mult2(a)
  return a * 2
end
```

- add(6, 3)
- 1 + add(1, 1)
- mult(2+1, 3)
- mult(2, 4) + add(3, 2)
- mult(add(1,1), add(3,2))
- mult2(3)
- mult2(add(1,2))

## Writing Methods

### Sum & Product

Write a method that takes one parameter, an array and returns the sum of all the elements in the array. For example:

```ruby
sum([1,2,3]) # evaluates to 6
sum([3,3]) # evalutes to 6
```

Write a method takes one parameter, an array and returns the product of all the elements in the array. For example:

```ruby
prod([1,2,3]) # evaluates to 6
prod([3,3]) # evaluates to 9
```

### First and Last

Write a method that takes on string and returns an array with the first and last words. For example:

```ruby
first_and_last("hello there") # evaluates to ["hello", "there"]
first_and_last("The fox jumped over the fence") # evaluates to ["The", "fence"]
```

_Hint_: You have to use the string split method.


### String joining

Write a method that takes two parameters, one array and one string and returns one string with the second string between each of the other strings. For example:

```ruby
join(["a", "b", "c"], ",") # evaluates to "a,b,c"
join(["hello", "there"], " ") # evaluates to "hello there"
join(["enter"], ",") # evaluates to "enter"
```

Notice that this method is the opposite of the split method for strings, So you should be able to do the following:

```ruby
join("hello there".split(" "), " ")
```

If you google how to do this, you will probably find that ruby already has a method on arrays called *join* that works as follows:

```ruby
["hello", "there"].join(" ")
```

*Don't use this method, that would be too easy, instead try to write what the method would do yourself.*

_Hint_: You will need an if statement to know if you are at the end of the array in order to know that you don't need to add the string in the middle.
