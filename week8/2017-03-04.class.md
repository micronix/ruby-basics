# Class methods and properties
Sometimes it is useful to have methods on the class itself, as opposed to on instances of the class.

For example, maybe you want to keep track of how many objects of a certain class type have been created.

```ruby
class Person
  @count = 0            # This creates an instance variable on the Person Class object

  def self.add_one      # Use self in the method definition to make it a class method instead of an instance method
    @count += 1
  end

  def initialize(name:)
    @name = name
    Person.add_one      # Class methods can be called by using the dot operator on the class instead of an instance
  end
end
```

# Inheritance in Ruby
So the, how do I write a class that inherits from another class in Ruby?


```ruby
class Rectangle
  def initialize(width, height)
    @width, @height = width, height
  end
  def area
    @width * @height
  end
end

class Square < Rectangle
  def initialize(width)
    super(width, width)
  end
end

```
# Modules
Sometimes it is useful to share a common set of methods between different classes without having those methods attached to a class directly.

Ruby provides a structure for this called a *module*

Example:

```ruby
module Greetings
    def hi
        puts "Hello. How's it going today?"
    end

    def bye
        puts "See you later."
    end
end

class Person
    include Greetings
end

jorge = Person.new

jorge.hi

jorge.bye
```
