  * <object>.object_id
  * <object>.class
  * References and Instances
  * Adding a Method

## Arrays and Methods

You can also take arrays as parameters and perform loops inside methods for example:

```ruby
def reverse(array)
  ret = []
  array.each do |item|
    ret.unshift(item)
  end
  return ret
end
```

Write the following methods the take an array as input and return another array:

- A method that takes an array of ints and returns an array with each integer in the first array increased by 3
- A method that takes an array and an integer and adds that integer to each element in the array
- A method that takes two arrays and returns the pair wise sum of the two arrays. 
For example [1, 2, 3] and [5, 6, 7] would return [6, 8, 10]

## Pass by reference

When we pass an array to a method we are passing the *reference* of the array.

The code inside the method can modify the array and the changes persist after we exit the method. For example:

```ruby
def change(array)
  array << 3
end

a = [1, 2]
change(array)
puts a
```

## The call came from inside the ~~house~~ Method

We have already seen that we can call a method from inside another method, such as:

```ruby
def add(a, b)
  return a + b
end

def prod(a, b)
  return a * b
end

def equation(a, b)
  c = add(a, b)
  d = mult(a, b)
  return c + d
end

puts equation(3, 2)
```

But you you can also call a method from inside itself.

For example:

```ruby
def fact(n)
  if n == 1
    return 1
  else
    return n * fact(n-1)
  end
end

puts fact(5)
```

This is called *recursion* and it can be shown mathematically that anything that can be done with loops can be done with recursion. 

For example:

```ruby
def sum(array)
  total = 0
  array.each do |item|
    total = total + item
  end
  return total
end

def sum(array)
  item = array.first
  if item.nil?
    return 0
  else
    return item + sum(array)
  end
end
```

# Objects and Object Oriented Programming

An object *encapsulates* *state* and *function*.

State - Properties, variables, and characteristics of an object

Function - Behavior of the object. Methods that can be performed with the object.

## Object Example


## Objects in Ruby
Everything in Ruby is an object

![Objects Everywhere](https://i.imgflip.com/1jfg8c.jpg)


## Creating Objects
Every variable we have created has been an object.

```ruby
hello = "Hello World"               # String object
the_answer = 42                     # Fixnum object
names = ['Juan', 'Kiha', 'Ariana']  # Array object
```

We can also create an object using `Object.new`

```ruby
thing1 = Object.new
thing2 = Object.new
```

## Object Uniqueness
Each unique object has an id which is stored on the `object_id` property for the object.

```ruby
thing1.object_id
things2.object_id
```

## Finding the Object Type
You can get the type of an object with the `class` property.

```ruby
thing1.class
thing2.class
hello.class
the_answer.class
names.class
```

## References and Instances
A variable holds a *reference* to an *instance* of an object.

Multiple variables can have references to the same instance.

```ruby
thing1.object_id
thing2.object_id
thing2 = thing1
thing2.object_id
```
