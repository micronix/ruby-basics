# Homework

Write a program that asks for the names of 3 people and their favorite color, then you can give it the name of a person and it tells you what their favorite color is. 

For example:

```bash
Person: Bob
Favorite Color: Red
Person: Alice
Favorite Color: Green
Person: Tom
Favorite Color: Orange
Give me a person: Bob
Bob's favorite color is Red
Give me a person: Tom
Tom's favorite color is Orange
Give me a person:
Good Bye!
```

Below is a suggested starting point. Use if you like.

```ruby
# get data
# ask name
# return color

def favorite_colors
  data = get_data
  name = ask_name
  color(data, name)
end

def get_data

end

def ask_name

end

def color(data, name)

end

favorite_colors
```
