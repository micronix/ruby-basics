# Spell checking

We are going to write a spell checker, first storing the dictionary of words in an array, and later using a hash instead.

We will use `curl` on the command line to retrieve a file. If you type the following command you should be able to download our dictionary file.

`curl -o dict.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/master/google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt`

*Make sure you are in the directory you want the file created in before running the curl command*

Next, copy the code below into a spellchecker.rb file.

```ruby
file = open('dict.txt')

dictionary = []

file.each do |word|
  dictionary << word.chomp
end

file.close

def check_for_word(dict, test_word)
  # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
end

loop {
  print "Enter a word to check if it is in the dictionary: "
  word = gets.chomp
  if word == ''
    break
  end

  if check_for_word(dictionary, word)
    puts "#{word} is a valid word"
  else
    puts "#{word} is not a word"
  end
}
```

Add the logic to the `check_for_word` function to search the array for the inputted word and return true if it was found, and false otherwise.

## Conver to using a hash

Hashes have many uses, but one thing that they excel at is quickly checking if a key exists in the hash.

If we store the dictionary of words with the word as the key then we could quickly check if a given word exists in our dictionary.

Given the following program, fill in the missing code so that it correctly spell checks the entered words.

```ruby
file = open('dict.txt')

dictionary = {}

file.each do |word|
  dictionary[word] = true     # We care more about setting the keys than what the value is for each key in this case
end

file.close

def check_for_word(dict, test_word)
  # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
end

loop {
  print "Enter a word to check if it is in the dictionary: "
  word = gets.chomp
  if word == ''
    break
  end

  if check_for_word(dictionary, word)
    puts "#{word} is a valid word"
  else
    puts "#{word} is not a word"
  end
}
```

## Spell checking a book

Building off the code above, we can also spell check an entire book.

First, get a book using the following command
`curl -o wild.txt http://www.textfiles.com/etext/FICTION/callwild`

Then, modify the code below to spell check the book, first by storing the dictionary in an array, and second by storing it in a hash.

```ruby
file = open('dict.txt')

dictionary = []
hash = {}

file.each do |word|
  word = word.chomp
  dictionary << word
  hash[word] = true
end

file.close

def check_array_for_word(dict, test_word)
  # YOUR CODE GOES HERE TO CHECK FOR THE WORD IN THE ARRAY
end

def check_hash_for_word(dict, test_word)
  # YOUR CODE GOES HERE TO CHECK FOR THE WORD IN THE HASH
end

def remove_punctuation_and_lowercase(word)
  word.downcase.gsub(/[^a-z ]/, '').chomp.strip
end

book = open('wild.txt')

book.each(' ') do |word|
  word = remove_punctuation_and_lowercase(word)
  if !word.empty?
    if !check_array_for_word(hash, word)
      puts word
    end
  end
end

book.close
```

After using the array version to spellcheck the book, change to use the hash object instead.

What differences did you notice between the two?


# Extra

The program below is extra if you want to do additional work with hashes.

## Modifying a program

The following program reads information from a file named ages.yml and create a hash from it. 

The format of the file is called yaml and it is a useful way of representing hashes in a file.

```ruby
require 'yaml'

ages = YAML.load(File.read('ages.yml')) # create the hash
age_counts = Hash.new(0) # we want the default value to be zero

ages.each do |name, age|
  age_counts[age] = age_counts[age] + 1
end

puts age_counts.inspect # display the contents of the hash

ages_count.each do |age, count|
  # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
end
print "The most common age is: "
```

```yaml
Elinor Violet: 16
Marta Chau: 22
Merry Uyeda: 17
Rhiannon Heslop: 23
Doris Pickron: 4
Roger Wax: 18
Vanetta Lentini: 25
Royal Helmers: 99
Olene Mustard: 18
Ha Kammerer: 16
Nathalie Costa: 30
Shaina Corso: 16
Patsy Moroney: 20
Hyun Zinke: 20
Rosalina Sallis: 7
Gina Hagens: 22
Neoma Quashie: 16
Sylvia Middaugh: 12
Kiyoko Griffey: 18
Hung Lauderback: 16
```

- Copy and paste the code into a file called ages.rb
- Copy and paste the yaml data into a file and call it ages.yml
- Run the code and it should output a hash where the keys are the ages and the values are the number of times the age appears

Questions

- Why does count have to be a hash with default value of 0? What would happen if it was just a normal hash?
- After we created a hash where the key is the age and the value is the number of times that age appears, we could use that hash to determine the most common age. 
The way to do this is to iterate through the hash and using a variable to keep track of the most common age and another variable that keeps track of how many times the most common age appears. 
Write code in order to determine what the most common age is.
